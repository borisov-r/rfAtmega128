Simple PCB with ATmega128RFa1 processor and usb. 
Main application of this board will be in our RepRap projects.

This work is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 or (at the user's discretion) any later version.
Software that will be used in this project is completely free and should be licensed under GPL v2 or later.

As a pins and code reference I'll use zigduino project:

============================================================================

Components:
1. ATmega128RFa1 -> 64 pins QFN @ 3.3 V
2. FT232RL       -> 28 pins     @ 3.3 V
3. BA033         -> 5 pins      @ -0.3 - 35 V
4. 2450FB15L0001 -> 6 pins      - RF balun
5. MCP809T-270I/TT -> added to RESET pin for programming
6. tunning capacitors -> 22 pF, 0.5 - 1.5 pF, 0603
7. RPSMA connector or PCB antenna
8. ICSP connector

============================================================================

Basic processes of the foundries should be examined and compared, so a simplified
trasistor model could be generated for more universal design.

Other option is a model to be generated according the needs and after that the most
suitable foundry should be chosen.

============================================================================

Schematic and layout design will be done using KiCAD.
Eventually a 3D models of the components will be added to the PCB.

============================================================================

Additional software for testing should be implemented.
